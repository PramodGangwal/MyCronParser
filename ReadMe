### Not For External Use.
This library is only for personal use and is not intended to be used for any production applications.

### Basic-cron-parser
This is a very basic-cron-parser library that handles only the bare minimum functionality.

#### Usage
- Takes only one string parameter
- The string parameter is a space separated string which contains the cron scheduling information (5 units of time) and command that is to be executed
- The order of the cron scheduling information is the following:
 - The first cron schedule unit denotes the minutes at which the command is to be executed.
 - The second cron schedule unit denotes the hours at which the command is to be executed.
 - The third cron schedule unit denotes the days of the month at which the command is to be executed.
 - The fourth cron schedule unit denotes the months at which the command is to be executed.
 - the fifth cron schedule unit denotes the days of the week at which the command is to be executed.
 - The sixth and the last cron schedule unit denotes the command to be executed.

#### Exceptions
- The cron parser doesn't support all the standard/complex parsing logic and throws illegal argument exception.
- It will throw an exception if it is not able to parse the argument value.

#### Supported Features
- Supports Minutes, hours, days, months & week days.
- Supports usage of * in the time units
- Supports ranges of the time units
- Supports comma separated list of time units
- support String format for the Months (JAN, FEB etc.) and weeks (SUN, WED etc.)
- Supports basic use of the slashes.

#### Unsupported Features
- Does not support all the standard/complex parsing logic and throws illegal argument exception.
- Does not support complex and mixed parsing logic (like *\[2-5] etc.).
- Does not support L usage in months and weeks.
- Does not verify that the the number of the days for the month is the correct (eg Feb should have 28 on leap years otherwise 29).
- Does not verify the double usage of question mark (?) in the argument.
